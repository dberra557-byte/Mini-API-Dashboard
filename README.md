# Mini-API-Dashboard
API Dashboard Project

This project is a single-page dashboard featuring 8 mini apps, each using a different real-world public API. The goal of this assignment was to practice using fetch(), async/await, API response handling, and DOM manipulation in JavaScript.

Features

What It Does

Each grid section works independently and fetches live data from its API, then updates the UI dynamically using JavaScript.

How to Run

This project works best when hosted.
You can run it using:

GitHub Pages (recommended)

VS Code Live Server

Any local development server


Opening the file using file:// may block some APIs due to browser restrictions.
